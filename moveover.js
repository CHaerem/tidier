// Moving a browser from Sidebery to Tidier's own folders (PLAN.md, part D). Sidebery once
// drew the tab list, folders and spaces; its folders were pages of its own, one in each
// window, with their tabs nested under them, and the record had each page as a folder. A
// browser was moved over by a click on the settings page. One that never was is moved at its
// first start without Sidebery, in the same order:
//
//   1. A copy of everything (copies.js): through the native host, or else in Firefox's own
//      storage (`copyBeforeMove`).
//   2. Sidebery's folders become Tidier's own in the record, which is written before anything
//      else happens: each keeps its tabs, which stay saved tabs, and its name. Which of them
//      Sidebery had closed comes from its export, taken in before or after (importSidebery).
//   3. Only then are the folder pages closed (closeOldFolderPages). A crash at any point
//      leaves either the old record, and the move happens at the next start, or the new one,
//      and pages that close at the next start.
//
// Sidebery should be disabled first: with it running, closing a folded folder's page closes
// the tabs in it. Even then nothing is lost: those tabs close before Tidier has started, which
// it does not take for your doing (tabs.onRemoved, tabsync.js), and as saved tabs they get
// their placeholders back as it starts. A click asked for the optional permissions; a move
// by itself leaves them to the sidebar, which asks for hiding tabs (sidebar/sidebar.js).
