// A closed folder rests: closed means out of the list, out of ⌃Tab and out of memory.
// Sidebery had settings for those and a delay before it unloads; here it is one fixed
// behaviour, with neither.
//
// Hiding is showSpace's (spaces.js): a tab in a closed folder is not `visible`. Firefox
// cannot hide the selected tab, so that one goes when you leave it. Selecting a hidden
// tab shows it again: Firefox does that itself.
//
// Unloading is here, and only at a moment you chose: closing a folder, a tab arriving in
// a closed one, and leaving a tab in one. So there is nothing to cancel, no idle work,
// and nothing at a start or an update, when a page must not be thrown away just because
// Tidier started. Opening a folder loads nothing: a page loads when you select it, as
// any unloaded tab does. (A click with the mouse reaches this half a second later, once
// it is clear it is not the first of a double click, which renames: see sidebar.js.)

// nothing about what is loaded (and a placeholder unloads itself once Firefox shows its
// icon, see unloadGhost in tabsync.js; sooner, it would have none).
//
// tabs.discard and not unloadSaved: the tab keeps the address it is on, since only
// closing a saved tab takes it back to its saved address. A page with unsaved input
// refuses without asking (see closesQuietly, tabsync.js), stays loaded, and nothing more
// happens: no retry, and no message about something you did not ask for.
//
// What keeps working stays loaded: the tab you are on, a tab playing sound, and a call
// or a shared screen (no sound is heard in a silence, and unloading would hang up). A
// live folder's tabs are left to its search (livefolders.js).
