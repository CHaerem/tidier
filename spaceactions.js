// What a space's menu does (sidebar/spacemenu.js), carried out through sidebarAction
// in sidebar-view.js.

// Unload a space, to free its memory, without losing anything: a row dims and its
// page comes back when you select it.
//
// Every window is asked, since the row you right-clicked is often a placeholder and
// its page is loaded in another window. Only tabs with a page are unloaded: a loaded
// placeholder unloads itself once it has its icon (unloadGhost, tabsync.js), and would
// have none if unloaded sooner. A selected placeholder is a page on its way to you, so
// a tab whose placeholder is selected in any window stays too.
//
// Stays: essentials (always there and ready, as in Zen and Arc; one can be unloaded by
// hand), the selected tabs, tabs playing sound, and tabs using the camera, microphone or
// screen (unloading would end a call, and one with everybody quiet plays no sound). A
// page with unsaved input refuses without asking (closesQuietly, tabsync.js), and stays.
// One call per tab, since Firefox refuses a whole list for one tab closed meanwhile.
//
// No space, nothing to do: a query without a container is every space's tabs.
