// Tab sync: regular tabs "live" across windows, like Zen's window sync.
//
// Firefox ties a tab to one window, so a tab cannot really be in two windows.
// Instead every synced tab is *live* in exactly one window, and every other
// window has an unloaded *ghost* of it (same URL, title and container). When
// you select a ghost, the live tab is moved into your window and the window it
// came from gets a ghost instead. There is always only one loaded copy of each tab.
//
// A folder is only an entry in the record (ownfolders.js): a tab is in it by its
// `parentKey`, the same in every window.
//
// - New tab / navigating a new tab to a page -> ghosts appear in other windows.
// - Closing a tab (live or ghost)            -> closed in every window.
// - Closing a saved tab (in a folder) while
//   it is loaded                             -> unloaded, back to its saved
//                                               address, in every window
//                                               (see closeAction, common.js).
// - Reopening it (⌘⇧T)                       -> it takes its placeholder's place.
// - Selecting a ghost, or focusing a window
//   whose selected tab is a ghost            -> the live tab is pulled in.
// - Closing a window                         -> its live tabs are taken over
//                                               by a ghost in another window.
// - Pinning a tab                            -> it becomes an essential and
//                                               leaves tab sync.
