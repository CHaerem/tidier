// News: a still dot when a page you are not looking at has something
// new. Across spaces this is how you see that chat or mail moved without going there.
//
// Firefox only tells that a tab's title changed, and titles change for many reasons,
// so there is one built-in rule and nothing to set: a loaded tab you are not looking at
// gets a mark when its title says something new (isNews) after NEWS_QUIET_MS of quiet.
// A page that has just loaded or that you have just left is still setting its title
// (an app starting, an unread count catching up), and that is not news.
//
// Looking at a tab means it is selected in the window you are using. Selected in another
// window is not enough: that window may be behind this one, and every window has a
// selected tab that nobody chose, since Firefox and Tidier pick one there when its tab
// is closed or pulled away (pull, tabsync.js). Taking that as seen would eat a dot and
// leave that tab without one for as long as it stays selected there.
//
// A mark belongs to the tab record or the essential, not to the Firefox tab: the other
// windows show the same tab as a placeholder, and selecting that one is seeing the news
// too. It lives in memory only (a restart clears it) and goes when you see the tab, or
// when the page itself is gone. Nothing here runs by itself: the five seconds are
// compared when a title changes, so there is no timer, and with nothing happening
// there is no work.

// Whether going from one title to another says something new.
//
// Digits alone say nothing: that is a clock, a timer or a percentage, which would
// otherwise mark a tab all day. The exception is a number in brackets, the way pages
// write an unread count ("(3) Inbox", and Gmail's "Inbox (1,234) - ..."): that going up
// is news, going down is you having read it elsewhere. Any other change of words is news,
// unless the new title is only what is left of the old one ("* general" to "general",
// the same mark going away because you read it on your phone).
