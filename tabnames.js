// The name sits next to the page's title, never in it. Everything that follows a page
// writes `title` and `icon` (updateFromCopy, tab sync's onUpdated) and unloadSaved
// copies `saved` over the entry, and none of those knows `name`, so nothing but this
// can change it. Clearing it therefore gives the page's title back as it is by then.

// A name lives as long as what it names: an essential's goes with its list entry, a
// saved tab's with `saved` when it leaves its folder (noteSaved, common.js), and being
// made an essential takes it along (onPinned, essentials.js). It travels with copies
// (copies.js) because it is simply part of the entry.
