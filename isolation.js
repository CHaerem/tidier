// Isolation: a space is a container, with logins of its own, and
// nothing ever goes out in the wrong one. It should be something nobody has to think
// about, so nearly all of it has no face; what has one is on the settings page
// (settings/spaces.js) and in the menus (sidebar/isolation.js).
//
//   1. Every top-level request is looked at before it leaves. A web page outside any
//      container, or one a rule sends elsewhere, is stopped and opened in the right
//      place. Without the permission (it is optional, so no update ever waits for a
//      click) spaces.js reopens the tab afterwards, as it always did: then the first
//      request has gone out in the wrong container.
//   2. A space can have a proxy and a user agent of its own.
//   3. Signing out: one site's cookies in a space, or everything in a space.
//   4. New, edited and deleted spaces, so Firefox's container settings aren't needed.
//   5. A container that vanished behind Tidier's back comes back.
//   6. A copy of a tab, and a whole folder, to another space.
//
// Nothing here contacts anyone by itself, and with nothing happening nothing runs.

// --- 1. No request in the wrong container ------------------------------------------
// Every website (http, https and their web sockets), and no local files: "<all_urls>" would
// also put "Access local files on your computer" in Firefox's list of what Tidier may do, where
// none of it is used here. (Only pictures of pages need it in that form, and ask for it
// themselves: settings/pictures.js.) One given as "<all_urls>" still
// counts: Firefox finds this inside it, and keeps it over an update.

// A page outside any container goes to a space, always: no web page is ever loaded
// outside one, so no login can land there. To the rule's if one matches, else
// the active one.
//
// So does a link from another app that Firefox has put in a container itself. Firefox
// gives such a link the container of the visible tabs on the same site, counting every
// window (URILoadingHelper.guessUserContextId), and pinned tabs are always visible to it:
// the space with the most essentials on a site wins, whichever space you are in. With two
// workplaces on the same sites, the other one's login would go out first, and a one-time
// sign-in link would be used up there. That container is Firefox's choice, not yours, so
// it counts as none: its first request goes where a link with no container goes. (The
// dotfiles' browser.link.force_default_user_context_id_for_external_opens turns the guess
// off in Firefox itself; this holds without it.)
//
// In a space, a rule counts only for what you chose yourself: a tab's first page, or a
// navigation nobody's page asked for. A link followed inside a page and a redirect do not,
// so a sign-in passing through an address does not move your tab (with Sidebery's rules it
// did). The same address again, with no page asking, is a reload or Firefox
// restoring the tab, and you chose neither. A popup is a sign-in talking to the page that
// opened it, which moving it would break.
//
