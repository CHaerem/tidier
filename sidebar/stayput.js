// list moves by itself for one thing only: the selected tab became another one, which is
// wholly out of view. Then it moves by the least distance, and leaves you alone from
// there. A clicked row is in view, so the list does not move under the pointer; a tab
// opened in the background is not selected, so it does not move the list at all. (One
// exception: leaving a selected tab in a closed folder takes its row out of the list, so
// rows below it in view come up by one row. With that row above the view nothing shows,
// since Firefox keeps what you see in place.)
//
// In a block, so that no name here can clash with another sidebar script: a clash in a
// plain script stops that whole script.
