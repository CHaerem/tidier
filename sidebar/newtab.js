// A double click on the empty part of the list opens a new tab in the space, in the
// same place as the new tab button (newtabs.js). A middle click there is left out,
// since a trackpad has none.
//
// Both clicks must have been on the empty part. What was under the pointer can go
// between the two (the × of the last row closes it), and the second click then lands
// on the empty part, where Firefox still reports a double click. So the first click
// is seen at the window, first, wherever it lands: a tile, or a row that keeps its
// events to itself, must not leave the answer from a click long ago.
