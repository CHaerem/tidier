"""An MCP server, so that Claude Code and other agents can work in the browser.

    claude mcp add tidier -- python3 -I /path/to/tidier/native/tidier-mcp.py

Started by the agent, and speaking MCP to it over stdin and stdout: one JSON message
per line. Standard library only. It passes each tool call on over the Unix socket of
native/tidier-bridge.py to Tidier, in Firefox, which decides what is allowed (bridge.js):
what the agent can see, which spaces, read or write. Nothing here can allow more.

This part only refuses what no agent should ever be told is possible (going to file:,
about: or an extension's pages; the extension refuses those too), and keeps answers
to a size an agent can take. Such an address is still passed on, marked as refused here
and with nothing to carry out, so that the person sees the attempt in Tidier's log: an
agent steered by a page to open ~/.ssh is what they most want to know about.
