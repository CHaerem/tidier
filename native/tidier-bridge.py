"""The bridge between Firefox and agents: a native messaging host for Tidier.

    agent <-stdio/MCP-> tidier-mcp.py <-Unix socket-> this <-native messaging-> bridge.js

Tidier starts this with connectNative only while the bridge is on, and it lives
exactly as long as that port: when Firefox closes the port (Stop, turning it off,
Firefox quitting or crashing) its stdin ends, and the socket and the process go at
once. So with the bridge off there is no process and no socket.

This part only carries messages. It decides nothing and does nothing on behalf of
a message: what an agent may see and touch is decided in the extension (bridge.js),
and no message can make this open a file or run anything. Web pages cannot reach it
at all: they cannot call connectNative, and the extension's content script is never
told about this port.

The socket is the only way in, never TCP. It is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tidier/bridge.sock
(default ~/.config/tidier/), mode 0600, so only you can connect, and each connection's
user is checked as well.
