// What Tidier can do from a key, in one table, shared with the command bar: each
// command has a name (the one in manifest.json), a label (the manifest's description,
// which Firefox's own page shows too; a unit test keeps the two the same), the key
// Tidier gives it (keys-commands.js) and an action that takes the window. The keys are
// changed on the settings page.
//
// Arc's keys, where Firefox lets an extension have them. "Ctrl" means ⌘ on a Mac, as
// Firefox writes it, and "MacCtrl" means ⌃. The keys are given at the first start
// (keys-commands.js), not in the manifest: there a key some other command already has is
// left out rather than doubled, and the settings page can give them all back.
//
// - ⌥⌘ and an arrow, Arc's next and previous tab and space, cannot be had: Firefox's
//   tab box takes them first (ShortcutUtils.getSystemActionForEvent), and about:keyboard
//   has no say over it. So ⌃⌘ and an arrow, one finger along.
// - ⌘1 to ⌘9, ⌘D and ⇧⌘C work once Firefox's own keys are cleared in about:keyboard
//   (customKeys.json in the dotfiles). Firefox's key on a letter comes first, and an
//   extension's never acts. On a digit both act when the keyboard is in a page: an
//   extension's key acts on keydown, but the page's process has by then also been sent the
//   keypress, and Firefox's key acts when that comes back.
// - Copying the address works in any window of Firefox's, a small or a private one too.

// It says so, as Arc does: from the keys nothing else shows that it worked.
