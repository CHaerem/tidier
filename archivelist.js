// Firefox's Recently Closed cannot be that list: it knows no container, it is kept per
// window, and it has nothing for a placeholder (a tab whose real page was in a window
// you closed, see keepReason in archive.js). So this list decides the space, and holds
// the address from the tab record, not the placeholder's own.
//
// It works only when something closes: then it is written, and old entries go. With
// nothing happening it does nothing, and the view (sidebar/archived.js) reads from memory.
//
// A tab moved to another space, a live folder's pull request and a saved tab that only
// unloads are not closed for good, so they never come here: only the two callers of
// noteArchived decide what does (archiveIdleTabs, and onSyncedClosed in tabsync.js).
