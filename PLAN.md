# The plan

Everything that has to be done, in order, with what "done" means. The goal and
the background are in the README, and the features to aim for in FEATURES.md.
Tick things off here as they land, so the next person can see where things are.

**In short:** Tidier takes over from Sidebery step by step, while the daily
Firefox keeps working as it does today. A second Mac runs Tidier alone first.
The daily browser moves over when Tidier alone is good enough, and only then is
Sidebery removed and sync added.

Rules for all of it:

- **Every commit on main reaches the daily browser**, so everything for Tidier
  alone sits behind a setting that is off by default. With it off, nothing changes.
- **Every step has a check**, in the test Firefox with Sidebery or without it.
- **Nothing that exists only for Sidebery gets better from here.** It is kept
  working until it can be removed.
- **Nothing can lose tabs without a way back.** Moving the daily browser is
  explicit, can be resumed, and can be undone.

## A. A safe core (needed with or without Sidebery)

- [x] Documents stay out of the signed extension; changing them is no release.
- [x] A green run on main can always release; a run started by hand cannot leave
      a commit behind. The second try of a smoke test is in the job, with a warning.
- [x] A passing fault at addons.mozilla.org does not lose a release; what to do
      with a bad release is written down.
- [x] A start with no windows keeps the tab record; a saved tab's last copy comes back.
- [x] An error during a start does not leave Tidier off; an essential in a removed
      container does not stop it.
- [x] A tab whose real page was in a closed window is not archived without a trace.
- [x] ⌘⇧T on an essential does not double it, and doubles cannot lose another.
- [x] Placeholders do not stay loaded when a new window gets many tabs, and the
      test no longer calls that a Sidebery bug.
- [x] A check of an update over a running session: same tabs, essentials and
      folders before and after.
- [x] Tests see errors inside Tidier, show why Firefox did not start, and the
      restart checks cannot quietly disappear from a green run.
- [x] A second ghost selected within 0.7 s of a pull opens; a tab closed within
      0.6 s of a pull closes everywhere.
- [x] A title or icon change writes the tab record only when something changed.
- [x] A page with unsaved input is not closed by archiving or a live folder.
- [x] Tidier keeps a copy of its own data: essentials, folders and saved tabs, as a
      dated file through the native host, taken in again from Tidier itself. A copy also
      holds the spaces with their rules and order, and lands in the space of the same name
      on another machine.
- [x] A live folder that has stopped (no host, no `gh` login) shows it.
- [x] README's permissions, files and claims match what is there.
- [x] What random use and a long run in a real Firefox found in code the daily browser
      shares: a pin of a tab Tidier is busy with counts, an unpin is always yours, a tab with
      no copy anywhere is taken for closed only right after Firefox starts, and a saved tab
      closed within half a second of another close goes back to its saved address instead
      of being removed. The Sidebery checks and a long run with Sidebery pass.

## B. Tidier alone (behind the setting)

A first version of all of it works in the test Firefox, without Sidebery.

- [x] **The setting and the test Firefox.** `tidierAlone`, from the extension's storage or
      declared in managed storage for a machine. A test Firefox without Sidebery, run in
      every smoke test. With the setting on, what exists only for Sidebery does not run.
- [x] **The sidebar as the sidebar.** A key and a button for it, back after an update.
      Checks of what it shows and does, and of its idle cost. It draws only what
      changed, so clicks and drags are not lost.
- [x] **Spaces.** Other spaces' tabs hidden, also from ⌃Tab (`tabHide`, optional, so
      updates never wait for a click). Switching with the bar and ⌃1/2/3, also to an
      empty space. New tabs and links from other apps in the active space. Closing the
      last tab of a space stays in the space.
- [x] **Folders as Tidier's data.** Create, rename, delete, fold. A folder has no tab
      of its own, and no tab event can delete it. Saved tabs, archiving and live
      folders work on these folders.
- [x] **Using it.** Drag tabs, into and out of folders, between essentials and tabs and to
      other spaces; the order follows in every window. A new tab button. Tidier's own
      menu on tabs, tiles, folders, spaces and the list. Sound indicator and mute. Keys.
- [x] **Rules.** An address always opens in a given space, edited in Tidier.
- [x] **Settings in Tidier.** A page for the rules, spaces' names, archiving, copies and
      moving over.
- [x] **What Sidebery does well**, in Tidier's own simple way: a short menu of Tidier's own on
      every tab, selecting several tabs, one quiet line with undo, Clear, a list that shows where
      you are, one place for new tabs, closed folders that rest, sound and news marks, honest
      dragging, safe moves. Sidebery has hundreds of options; each became one fixed
      behaviour or nothing.
- [x] **Container session isolation**, as strong as Sidebery's: nothing goes out in the wrong
      container, a space's own proxy and user agent, signing out, spaces made, changed and deleted in
      Tidier, a vanished container brought back, a copy of a tab and a folder to another space.
- [x] **The command bar**, as in Arc: one key, one field, everything from it. Shortcuts as in Arc.
- [x] **Finding archived tabs**, a small window for links from other apps, and link preview.
- [x] **A refined design**: judged from screenshots, in light and dark, at every width.
- [x] **Very robust and efficient**: random use checked against what must always hold, a long
      run in a real Firefox, and measured with up to 1000 tabs.

All of part B is checked in the test Firefox, in release Firefox and in Developer Edition.
What a test Firefox cannot show is left for the second Mac: a real trackpad and drag and drop,
links from real apps, real sound and calls, and real Firefox Sync between two machines.

## C. Trying it on the second Mac

- [ ] It gets Firefox as default, and the Firefox files from dotfiles, declared in its
      own configuration. Its commits are signed: an unsigned commit in dotfiles
      stops the Firefox updates on the daily Mac.
- [ ] Tidier alone from a clean Firefox, from what is written down, with no Sidebery.
- [ ] Used for real for a while; what is missing goes in here and in FEATURES.md.

## D. Moving the daily browser

- [ ] A copy taken first, by hand, of the whole Firefox profile and Sidebery's export.
- [x] Rules and order of spaces imported from Sidebery's export, which is the only
      place they can be read from, also the address rules of its panels and which folders
      were closed.
- [x] One explicit click, never an update: a report of what will happen, then the
      record is written, and only then are folder pages closed. It can be undone.
      Checked with a real Sidebery in the test Firefox, there and back.
- [x] After the move no tab is hidden until the settings page is back in front, so that
      Firefox's question about hidden tabs comes while the page says what to answer, and not
      over the sidebar. Another window, which Firefox leaves without Tidier's sidebar, shows
      the page too, with a button for it.
- [ ] Sidebery disabled but installed for a few weeks.

## E. Without Sidebery, everywhere

- [ ] Sidebery and all that exists because of it removed: folders first, its tree
      rules, waiting for its sidebar, `tests/fixtures/sidebery.json`, `tools/fix_spaces.py`,
      and its files in dotfiles (in that order, or releases stop).
- [x] Essentials, folders and spaces on every machine by Firefox Sync, within its limits.
      Built and checked in a test Firefox, off by default; real Firefox Sync between two
      machines is not tried yet.
- [x] Spaces hidden per machine. Hidden only: the data is on every machine.
- [ ] Every Mac set up the same way.

## Stretch goal: made for working with Claude and other agents

Off by default. Copying a page or tabs as clean text for Claude. An MCP server so Claude
Code can work in the browser, local only. Agents get a space of their own with its own
logins, see and touch only that, unless you allow more. What they do shows, and one
click stops it.

- [x] All of it is there with Tidier alone, off by default, and checked; not yet tried with
      Claude Code itself.

## F. After that

What FEATURES.md has as Later, starting with what is missed most in use.

## Choices made

Changed by saying so. All of them can be reversed.

- A tab that is only a placeholder is archived like any other (Tidier alone), the time counting
  from when it became one, since Tidier's own list holds its address and can bring it back. With
  Sidebery it is kept until you have selected it: Recently Closed would have nothing of it.
- Closing the last window and quitting brings your tabs back unloaded.
- A failed smoke test gets one more try, marked with a warning. To be looked at
  again once it is known how often the first try fails.
- A failure in Developer Edition only stops releases until restart is also
  tested in release Firefox; then it only warns.
- Archiving counts clock time: a night away closes yesterday's ordinary tabs.
- `tabHide` is optional, asked for when Tidier alone is turned on, so that no update
  ever waits for a click. Firefox shows hidden tabs again at each update, so
  Tidier hides them again when it starts.
- Essentials stay pinned tabs, so other spaces' essentials stay in ⌃Tab; Firefox
  cannot hide a pinned tab.
- A link opened from a tab in a folder is an ordinary tab, as in Arc (Tidier alone).
- No page's first request goes out in the wrong container: it is stopped before it
  leaves, as Sidebery does. That takes access to all websites, so it is optional, asked
  for in the same click as hiding tabs. Without it a link's first request goes out with
  no container before it is opened in its space, as before: it carries no login.
- An address that belongs in another space opens there, and the tab it was typed in stays
  if it holds anything: a page's history or a saved tab is not lost for it. A rule's
  regular expression runs on a small engine of Tidier's own, since Firefox's can take for
  ever on every navigation. That engine has no look-around or back-references: such a rule
  does nothing, and the settings page says so. A rule with a slash but no valid flags after
  the last one is plain text, as in Sidebery.
- A rule for a space that is gone does nothing, and says so in the sidebar and on the
  settings page. One for a space hidden on this machine opens the tab where you are, and
  says so in the sidebar.
- A pinned tab is an essential, also one reopened after its essential was removed.
- A page is loaded once. A selected copy of it in a window you are not using becomes a
  placeholder, and the page comes to you when you go to that window.
- Clear asks nothing: one line offers Undo. Closing several tabs and deleting a folder work
  the same way.
- Tabs moved to another space go to the end of its tabs, not where new tabs go, so several
  moved together keep their order.
- Small windows for links from other apps have one on-off on the settings page, to be looked
  at again after the second Mac.
