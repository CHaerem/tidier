// Moves that cannot lose anything.
//
// Firefox cannot change a tab's container, so a move to another space is a reopen:
// a new tab there, and the old one closed. Three things can then go wrong, and each
// would lose something you did not choose to lose: a rule sends the new tab straight
// back (spaces.js), the old tab held unsaved input, or the new tab cannot be opened
// at all. moveToSpace (ownfolders.js) and byRule (spaces.js) use what is here.

// --- A tab no rule may send away ------------------------------------------------
// Firefox creates a tab on about:blank and loads its address a moment later, so a
// tab opened with an address still counts as new, and its first page goes past the
// rules (firstPage, byRule). The events and the answer to tabs.create can come in any
// order. So: if the tab is still waiting for its first page, it stops waiting; if
// that page has already been seen, a byRule is queued, and the mark tells it to leave
// this tab alone. A byRule that runs while a tab is still being opened (openUnruled
// can be called outside the queue) waits for the answer first; the answer does not
// depend on the queue, so this cannot hang.
