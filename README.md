# Tidier

A calmer, tidier Firefox: spaces, the same tabs in every window, and tabs
that tidy themselves, in the spirit of Zen and Arc but in Firefox itself.

(It was called Kitsune until November 2026; Mozilla's support site already
uses that name. The add-on's ID is the same, so it updates as before.)

## The goal

**Firefox that feels calm, ordered and clean: just Firefox and Tidier.**
Zen and Arc showed how a browser can feel; Zen is a fork of Firefox that
trails its security updates, and Arc is being wound down. Tidier gives the
same way of working to ordinary Firefox, which updates itself and fits
company policy, as one extension.

What that means:

- **Firefox and Tidier, nothing else.** No other extension is needed.
- **As much as possible in Tidier.** What Tidier does itself, it controls:
  it can be tested, fixed and made to work together smoothly. Only what an
  extension cannot do is set up outside it, in the dotfiles: the window's
  look (`userChrome.css`) and Firefox settings no extension can change.
- **Your tabs, not the window's.** Every tab is in every window and loaded
  only once; a window is a view onto the same tabs.
- **Spaces.** One space per container (work, clients, private), each with its
  own essentials, folders and tabs, so logins never mix.
- **A browser that tidies itself.** Essentials are always there, tabs in
  folders are kept, and other tabs are archived when unused.
- **Calm by default.** Nothing moves unless you move it; nothing is loaded
  twice; with nothing happening, Tidier does nothing.
- **Under your control.** Everything is in this repository and the dotfiles,
  so any problem can be fixed here, not waited on elsewhere.
- **Seamless.** A push to main is tested in Firefox and Firefox Developer
  Edition (a month ahead) and, when it passes, signed and installed by
  Firefox itself. Nothing to do by hand.

### How it came about

Arc was the browser for years: three spaces (two workplaces and private), each
with its own essentials and logins so they never mixed, and unused tabs that
went away by themselves. When Arc was retired, Zen came closest, with an
extension for the tabs' lifetime. Then a workplace's sign-in requirement ruled
Zen out, and it became Firefox: settings, Sidebery for the sidebar, and this
extension for the rest. That works well, but it depends on Sidebery, and much
is still not as wanted. So Tidier is taking over what Sidebery does, step by
step, and then grows into everything wanted from Arc and Zen.

### Where it stands (November 2026)

The daily browser still runs on top of Sidebery, which draws the vertical tabs,
folders and the space bar; everything below this section describes that setup.

**Tidier alone** replaces it: Tidier's own sidebar (`sidebar/`, `sidebar-view.js`),
with essentials of the active space as tiles at the top, its folders and tabs below
and the spaces at the bottom; spaces that hide each other's tabs (`spaces.js`);
folders as Tidier's own data (`ownfolders.js`); rules for addresses; and a settings
page. It sits behind a setting, off by default, since Sidebery and Tidier would fight
over the same tabs: `tidierAlone` in the extension's storage, or declared for a
machine in managed storage. A browser is moved over on the settings page
(`moveover.js`), never by an update, and can be moved back.

With it come what Sidebery does well, each as one fixed behaviour: Tidier's own short
menu on tabs, tiles, folders and spaces; selecting several tabs; one quiet line with
Undo, and Clear for today's tabs; a list that shows where you are; one place for new
tabs; closed folders that rest, unloaded; marks for sound and news; honest dragging;
and moves to another space that cannot lose anything. Spaces are kept apart as strictly
as Sidebery does it, with a space's own proxy and user agent. Beyond Sidebery: a command
bar (⌘⇧K), keys that follow what the list shows, set in one place; a list of archived
tabs; a small window for links from other apps; the same essentials, folders and spaces
on every machine through Firefox Sync, with spaces hidden per machine; and, off by
default, Copy for Claude and a bridge for agents. All of it is checked in the test
Firefox, in release Firefox and Developer Edition, also with random use, and measured
with a thousand tabs. None of it has been used for real yet: what a test Firefox cannot show (a
real trackpad, links from real apps, real Firefox Sync between two machines) waits for
the second Mac.

In order: a second Mac on Tidier alone first; then the daily browser; then Sidebery
and what exists only because of it removed, and sync turned on. All of it is in
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

All the features worth having from Zen, Arc and Sidebery, and where Tidier
stands with each, are listed in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md). Everything that has to
be done, in order, is in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

Until then, what Sidebery does (the tab list, folders, the space bar, its
container rules) is left to it and set up in the dotfiles.

1. **Essentials in every window.** Pinned tabs are mirrored as unloaded copies
   in every window, in the same container (and therefore the same Sidebery
   space). Pinning or unpinning in one window does the same in the others.
   Closing an essential brings it back unloaded, like Zen. A new one goes
   after the others of its space (Sidebery shows them by space, and would
   sort them so when Firefox starts). Moving one keeps
   the new order, in every window and in new windows. Dragging one to another
   window takes it there (in its place, not twice) and leaves a copy behind. An essential's
   title and icon follow its page, but only from the essential's own site,
   so a redirect to a sign-in page does not rename it. Like every other tab,
   an essential is loaded in one window only (two loaded Slacks would play
   every notification sound twice): selecting its copy in the window you are
   using moves the loaded tab there and leaves an unloaded copy behind, and a
   copy that loads its page anyway (as after a restart) makes the others
   unloaded copies again (`essentials.js`, "One loaded copy").
2. **Tabs in every window.** Every other tab is *live* in one window and an
   unloaded *ghost* in the others (same URL, title, container and place in the
   Sidebery tree). Selecting a ghost moves the live tab into your window and
   leaves a ghost behind, so each page is only ever loaded once. Opening a tab
   adds it everywhere; closing it closes it everywhere; moving it into or out
   of a folder does the same in the other windows; closing a window hands its
   tabs over to another window.
3. **Folders first** (`folders.js`): in each space, Sidebery's folders, with
   the tabs in them, come before the ordinary tabs, like the pinned part of a
   space in Zen and Arc. Sidebery has no setting for it, and reordering with
   CSS would only change the picture, so Tidier keeps the real tab order:
   when a space does not start with its folders, the ordinary tabs above them
   are moved below them, one at a time (moving a folder would make Sidebery
   put the tabs it passes into it).
4. **Live folders** (`livefolders.js`): Sidebery folders filled from a GitHub
   pull request search, such as open pull requests in your company's
   organisation or your own repositories where you are author, assignee or
   asked for review. Refreshed every 15 minutes and at startup: new pull
   requests get an unloaded tab, merged or closed ones are removed (the one
   you are looking at once you leave it), and a
   renamed one's unloaded tabs take the new title. A pull request tab you
   close stays closed until it leaves the search.
5. **⌘⇧C copies the address** of the current tab, as in Arc and Zen
   (`shortcuts.js`). Firefox gives ⌘⇧C to the developer tools' element
   picker, which wins over extensions; free it in `about:keyboard` (the
   dotfiles do this in `customKeys.json`).
6. **Archiving**, as in Arc (`archive.js`): a tab not selected in any window
   for 12 hours is closed everywhere, and stays under History → Recently
   Closed Tabs (⌘⇧T). Essentials, folders and the tabs in them, selected tabs
   and tabs playing sound are kept, and so is a tab that is only a placeholder
   (its real page was in a window you closed) until you select it. The time never counts from before
   archiving was first turned on. Change it with `archiveAfterHours` in the
   extension storage (0 = off).
7. **Saved tabs**, like Arc's pinned section and Zen's pinned tabs (in
   `tabsync.js`, the rules in `closeAction` in `common.js`): a tab in a
   folder is *saved*. Closing it while it is loaded (⌘W, or Sidebery's ×)
   unloads it instead, in its place, in every window, and it goes back to the
   address it had when it came into the folder (browsing in it does not change
   that; its title and icon follow the page while it is on that address).
   ⌘⇧T reopens it in its placeholder's place. To remove a saved tab for good,
   close it while it is unloaded (the × on its placeholder, or a middle click),
   or drag it out of the folder, which makes it an ordinary tab again. Every
   other tab is temporary: closing it closes it everywhere, and archiving
   closes it when unused. A live folder's pull requests are not saved (the
   search decides what is in them), and the tabs of a folder you close with
   it in one window stay in the other windows.

Shortcuts, compact mode, sign-in and spaces are set up natively (Firefox
settings, `about:keyboard`, Sidebery), in the dotfiles. Switching to a tab in
another window needs no command either: every tab is in every window. With Tidier
alone, Tidier gives its keys itself, once, and they are changed in the settings
page's Keys section.

Sidebery folders (group pages) are copied per window, with the ghosts nested
under the copy. Closing a folder copy only affects its own window.

## Live folders and the native host

The pull request search runs in `native/github-prs.py`, a Firefox native
messaging host that calls the `gh` CLI with your existing login. No GitHub
token is stored in the browser. The folders are set up in a local file, not in
this repository: `~/.config/tidier/live-folders.json` (see
`native/live-folders.example.json`), one entry per folder with its name, its
container (so its space) and a GitHub search (`org:…`, `user:…`, `repo:…`).
The extension only learns each folder's id, name and container, and the host
only runs those searches; anything else is refused.

Install the host once (and again if this folder moves); it also creates the
config file from the example if there is none:

```bash
native/install.sh
```

It writes `~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts/tidier_github.json`,
which only allows this extension to start the host. The `native/` folder is not
part of the signed extension.

## Working with Claude and other agents

Two things, each off until you turn it on under *Claude and other agents* on the settings
page, on this machine only, and only with Tidier alone. Neither setting, nor what an agent
did in its space or left you, is part of a copy.

**Copy for Claude.** A tab's menu and the command bar get *Copy page for Claude* (title,
address and the page as clean Markdown; with several tabs selected, a list), *Copy these
tabs for Claude* (the space's folders and tabs as a list) and *Ask Claude about this page*
(copies it and opens claude.ai in the space you are in, with your login there). Your own keys
can be set for them in `about:addons`. Nothing is sent anywhere: you paste it, or do not. A
page that is not loaded is not loaded for this: you get its title and address.

**The bridge.** An MCP server, so that an agent such as Claude Code can work in the
browser. To add it, run `native/install.sh` once, turn it on on the settings page, and:

```bash
claude mcp add tidier -- python3 -I "$PWD/native/tidier-mcp.py"
```

An agent can then list spaces and tabs, open, go to, select and close tabs, read a page as
Markdown, take a screenshot, find elements, click, type, and wait for something to show up.
It can leave you a tab with a note in a folder *For you*, which exists only while it holds
something, and you can hand it a tab by dragging it to the Agent space's dot.

```
agent <-stdio-> native/tidier-mcp.py <-Unix socket-> native/tidier-bridge.py <-native port-> bridge.js
```

### What keeps this safe

- **Agents have a space of their own.** Turning the bridge on makes a space named Agent,
  with its own container and so its own logins. By default an agent can see and touch only
  that. It does not learn your other spaces or tabs exist. A rule never sends a tab out of it,
  nor a tab an agent opened in a space you opened to it on into a closed one.
- **Another space is your decision,** per space, on the settings page: closed unless you
  say otherwise, and *Can read* before *Can read and act*. A space you open is open with
  the logins in it, so a workplace's space is never opened by itself. Closing one counts at
  once, also for what an agent has under way there.
- **The decision is made in the extension,** in one place (`bridgeAllows`, `bridge.js`), on
  every call. The two scripts in `native/` only carry messages; anything you run could talk
  to the socket directly, and gets the same answers. No tool can change a setting or open
  a space: those messages are taken only from the settings page.
- **Never reachable, since no tool does it:** cookies, passwords, storage, downloads,
  files, Firefox's or Tidier's settings. Agents go to `http:` and `https:` only, never
  `file:`, `about:` or an extension's pages. What is in a form field is never read, not even
  by asking a selector about it letter by letter. A password
  or card field is left to you. Firefox fills in saved passwords in any container, and an
  extension cannot stop that, so on a page with a password filled in an agent cannot click
  or send a form: it could otherwise sign in to your account without knowing the password.
- **It cannot take you along.** An agent's tabs open in the background, a hundred in a
  space at most. A tab comes to the front only where you are already looking at its space.
- **It shows.** While an agent is at work, its space's dot has a thin ring and every sidebar
  has one line with its last action and a *Stop*. Stop cuts the bridge at once, also what
  is under way, and it stays off until you turn it on again. The settings page has a short
  log, with what was refused, kept only in memory and holding sites, not addresses.
- **Local only, and only while on.** `tidier-bridge.py` is started by Firefox and only
  Tidier may start it; it lives exactly as long as the port, so off means no process and no
  socket. The socket is `~/.config/tidier/bridge.sock`, mode 0600, in a folder only you can
  write to, and each connection's user is checked. There is no network port. Web pages
  cannot reach any of it: they cannot use native messaging, the only script Tidier puts in
  pages (for ⌥-click, below) only sends the address of a link you ⌥-clicked, and no page of
  Tidier's can be framed or loaded by them.
- **Pages can try to steer an agent.** Everything read from a page (text, titles,
  addresses, what `find` returns, a screenshot) goes back marked as untrusted, between markers
  with a random number the page cannot know, so it cannot write its own end to them.
  An agent is told that it is data and not instructions. Text a person cannot see is
  left out. **This is help, not a guarantee:** no marking can force a language model to
  ignore what it reads, and white text on a white background gets through.

What this does not do: it does not limit where an agent goes in its own space (a page may
start a download into your Downloads folder, as for you; Firefox asks before installing
an add-on), it does not hide a space you opened from it, and it does not protect you
from what you run yourself: anything running under your account can reach the socket while
it is on, and could read your Firefox profile anyway. Keep it off when you are not
using it. A note an agent leaves you can have been steered by a page as well. A
screenshot shows what the page shows, also a name typed in a field, and a rich text box
that is part of a page (not a form field) is read as the page's text.

Reading pages and screenshots need access to all websites, which is optional and asked
for in the click that turns these on. Without it an agent can still see tabs and addresses,
and a copy holds the title and address. A click in the sidebar does not give a page's
`activeTab` in Firefox (only its own menus, keys and toolbar button do), so that is not used.
It can be taken back in `about:addons`.

The checks are in `tests/bridge.test.mjs` (what is allowed, on a fake Firefox),
`tests/test_bridge.py` (the socket and the protocol, playing Firefox) and `alone_bridge` in
`tests/smoke.py` (end to end, in a real Firefox).

## Keys and the command bar

With Tidier alone, the keys follow what the sidebar shows (`shortcuts.js`,
`keys-commands.js`): ⌃⌘↓ and ⌃⌘↑ go to the next and previous tab as shown, past other
spaces' tabs and closed folders; ⌃⌘→ and ⌃⌘← to the next and previous space; ⌘1 to ⌘9 to
the n-th tab of this space, essentials first; ⌘D makes a tab an essential or ordinary
again; ⌥⌘N makes a new folder; ⌃1 to ⌃5, ⌃⇧S and ⌘⇧C are as before. Each key is given
once, at the first start with Tidier alone, and changed in the settings page's Keys
section; a key you change stays that way, and moving back to Sidebery takes them all back.
⌘1 to ⌘9 and ⌘D are Firefox's own until they are cleared in `about:keyboard` (the
dotfiles' `customKeys.json`); until then ⌘1 to ⌘9 can act twice with the keyboard in a
page. ⌘⌥ and an arrow stay Firefox's, in window order: no extension can have them.

The command bar (`commandbar.js`, `commandbar/`) opens with ⌘⇧K in a small window over the
one you are in, and with ⌘T too once Firefox's new tab key is cleared. One field finds
every tab of every space, essentials, folders, closed and archived tabs and commands, and
history and bookmarks once you allow them. Commands act on the tabs selected in the
sidebar, else on this one. Enter goes to a tab, or opens an address or a search in the
active space; ⌘↵ opens a new tab instead.

## The same on every machine, and spaces hidden on one

Both only with Tidier alone (`sync.js`, `syncmerge.js`, `hiddenspaces.js`).

**Sync** is off until you tick it on the settings page. Essentials, folders, saved tabs,
short names, rules, and spaces with their names, colours, icons and order then go into
Firefox Sync's storage for add-ons. Ordinary tabs, what is open, icons, which folders are
closed and which spaces are hidden stay on each machine, and so does everything of the
agents' space. No container number is shared: a space is matched to a container by
name, so logins cannot mix. The newest change wins per thing; something merely missing
never counts as deleted, and a page you have open is never closed by another machine.
Turning it on takes a copy first. Firefox Sync must carry add-on data: tick Add-ons in its
settings, or set `services.sync.engine.extension-storage.force`, which carries only that.
It is checked in one test Firefox; real Firefox Sync between two machines is not tried yet.
Removing a space on one machine does not remove it from the others.

**A hidden space** leaves the bar and every window on this machine, and ⌃1/2/3 skip it.
Nothing is deleted: showing it again brings everything back, unloaded. A rule for it opens
the tab in the space you are in and says so. Hide one on the settings page, or declare it
for a machine by name in managed storage, next to `tidierAlone`:
`"data": { "tidierAlone": true, "hiddenSpaces": ["Name of the space"] }`. Firefox reads
that file once each time Tidier starts, so a change there needs a restart of Firefox.

## Placeholders (ghost.html)

Firefox cannot give an unloaded tab a title or icon. Ghosts and essential
copies are therefore created as a tiny local page (`ghost.html`) that sets the
real page's title and icon and then asks to be unloaded; an unloaded tab keeps
both, so placeholders cost no memory once settled. It is unloaded when Firefox
reports the icon as shown, not after a fixed pause. The icon is the one saved
for the page, else the site's `/favicon.ico` if that loads. When shown, an essential
copy goes straight to the real page; a ghost has the live tab pulled in, and
only loads the real page itself if no live tab exists. When a live tab's title
or icon changes, its ghosts reload the placeholder to show it.

With Tidier alone a placeholder has no page at all: it is created unloaded, with its
title, which Firefox allows (but not together with pinned, so an essential's copy is
pinned right after). Tidier's sidebar draws it from Tidier's record, with the saved icon,
and ⌃Tab shows the title it was made with. That is what keeps a new window with a
thousand tabs to a few seconds.

Tabs that were never loaded have no title or icon to copy. For the initial
migration from Zen these were filled in from Zen's session data. An essential
that still has no icon takes the icon of the first tab on its site that you
open, and its copies are redrawn. This matters for sites behind a sign-in,
whose `/favicon.ico` leads to the sign-in page. Firefox's own icon cache
(`page-icon:`) cannot be loaded from an extension's process.

## Short names for essentials and saved tabs

An essential can have a `name` (e.g. "Jira") in the extension storage
(`essentials` list). Unloaded copies show it instead of the page title. With Tidier
alone it is set with Rename in the tab menu, also for a saved tab (`tabnames.js`),
and clearing it gives the page's title back. With Sidebery there is no UI for it;
set it with a script while the extension is disabled (the extension keeps the list
in memory and would overwrite the change).

## Tabs in the wrong space

Each space belongs to one container (its own logins), so a tab should always
be in its container's space. Sidebery keeps the space ("panel") of every tab
itself, does not apply its container rules to pinned tabs, and is not
predictable about the space of a tab another extension moves to a border
between spaces. No other extension can change Sidebery's choice. If tabs show
up in the wrong space:

```bash
tools/fix_spaces.py          # fix (restarts Firefox)
tools/fix_spaces.py --check  # only report
```

It sets each tab's space from its container (the container each space opens
new tabs in). The smoke test checks this for every tab in every window, also
after an essential is closed or pinned and after a tab is pulled in.

Links opened from outside Firefox (Slack, Mail, …) open in the active space's
container; Sidebery does that (its setting "reopen externally opened tabs").
It cannot for addons.mozilla.org, which Firefox shields from extensions. Firefox
itself gives such a link no container, unless a visible tab is on the same host, and
then that tab's container. With Tidier alone the link opens in a small window of its
own (`littlewindow.js`), in the rule's space or else the one you are in, to read and
close, or to keep with one click; it can be turned off on the settings page.

Sidebery's container rules ("reopen tabs with this URL in this container")
match a rule's text anywhere in every address a tab loads, including sign-in
redirects. `youtube.com` also matches `accounts.youtube.com`, which every
Google sign-in passes through, so a Google sign-in in another space is moved
to that container: the essential is closed (and comes back unloaded) and the
sign-in fails there. `teams.microsoft.com` likewise matches a Microsoft
sign-in that returns to Teams. Anchor such rules to the start of the address,
as a regular expression: `/^https:\/\/(www\.|m\.)?youtube\.com\//`.

## Sidebery's look and settings come from dotfiles

Sidebery's CSS (`sidebery.css`) and the settings that matter for Tidier
(`sidebery-settings.json`) are in dotfiles, which hands them to Sidebery as
*managed storage*: a file in `~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/ManagedStorage/`
that Firefox gives the extension. Sidebery reads it every time it starts, and
its values win over Sidebery's own, so nothing is pasted into Sidebery and a
change in Sidebery's settings page lasts only until the next start. The test
Firefox gets the same file built from the same dotfiles files (pointed at its
profile, since Firefox only looks in your own `~/Library`); the fixture's
settings are older values on purpose, so the tests show that dotfiles wins.
Spaces and container rules are not settings and stay in Sidebery's storage.

## Scrolling in the sidebar (Sidebery settings)

Scrolling only scrolls the tabs; spaces are switched with the buttons at the
bottom or ⌃1/2/3. Switching spaces by scrolling sideways was tried and left
out: a trackpad's vertical swipe also moves a little sideways, and the wheel
threshold that keeps such a swipe from switching space also makes Sidebery
block small vertical scroll events.

| Sidebery setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Use horizontal scroll to (`hScrollAction`) | do nothing | |
| Set threshold for switching between panels and tabs by scrolling (`wheelThreshold`) | off | with it on, Sidebery blocks vertical scroll events below the vertical threshold |
| Switch panels using vertical scroll over navigation bar (`navSwitchPanelsWheel`) | off | scrolling near the bottom would switch space |

These are set in dotfiles' `sidebery-settings.json` (see above).

## Known limitations

- An essential remembers the URL the tab had when it was pinned. Pin a page
  when it shows the app itself, not while it is redirecting to a sign-in or
  product page.
- An essential whose site you have not opened since it became one, and whose
  `/favicon.ico` does not load, shows the default icon until you do.
- Folders, including new live folders, start expanded in a new window (Sidebery does not let other
  extensions fold them).
- Sidebery requires each panel's tabs to be one contiguous run in panel order;
  after filling a window the extension copies the tab order from the window
  with the most synced tabs, with each space's tabs together (that window can
  have them mixed: Sidebery shows a tab added at the end of a window in its
  space without moving it there). That sort waits ~1.5 s for Sidebery to finish
  placing the new tabs; sorting sooner puts tabs in the wrong panel.
- A tab in a folder that you pull into another window (by selecting its ghost)
  takes its ghost's place there, but outside the folder; the
  ghost it leaves behind stays in the folder. Sidebery decides a moved-in tab's
  place in its tree itself, from the tab that opened it, and Firefox does not
  report an opener in another window, so no extension can put it in the folder.
- Moving a tab into or out of a folder is copied to the other windows, but
  not moving it elsewhere: Sidebery gives a tab another extension moves the
  space of the tab it lands next to, so moving ghosts around could change
  their space. Where the tab is live or selected, in a window you are not
  using, it stays where it was there. A new window takes the order of the window with the
  most tabs.
- Sidebery gives the first pinned tab of a new window to the active panel, so a
  throwaway pinned tab holds that spot while the essentials are created.
- A tab that exists before a new window's sidebar has started gets the last
  active space, whatever its container, and a pinned tab keeps its space. So a
  new window's essentials are created unpinned, and pinned only once Sidebery's
  sidebar there has started: their placeholders are loaded again every 0.5 s,
  so Sidebery moves them to their spaces once it runs, until Sidebery shows
  that it has (it hides the tabs of the other spaces, or sets which tab to
  select after closing the current one; at most 4 s; `PROBE_MS` and
  `SIDEBAR_WAIT_MS` in `common.js`). Just
  before pinning, each loads its placeholder once more and gets 0.6 s for
  Sidebery's container rule. The smoke test opens three windows to check. Up
  to Sidebery 5.6.1 a failure of that check is reported as `KNOWN` and does
  not block a release (`KNOWN_SIDEBERY_BUGS` in `tests/smoke.py`). The fix is
  [mbnuqw/sidebery#2497](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery/pull/2497); with a
  newer Sidebery the check is strict again.

## Performance (Firefox 159, Sidebery 5.6, 33 essentials + 53 tabs)

- New window: essentials after ~1.6 s, all tabs after ~1.6 s, sorted after
  ~3 s (measured before essentials waited for Sidebery's sidebar; pinning
  now comes ~0.7 s later). Placeholders load briefly and unload themselves;
  only folder copies stay loaded.
- Selecting a ghost: the live tab is in place after ~50 ms.
- With Tidier alone, in the test Firefox: a new window with the same tabs is ready in
  ~0.5 to 0.8 s; with 300 tabs in ~1.4 s, and with 1000 in ~7 s, with the extension's
  memory under 200 MB. Switching space takes ~0.15 s.

Timing constants live in `common.js`; re-measure if Sidebery or Firefox
changes how new tabs are handled.

## Permissions

`tabs`, `sessions`, `storage`, `cookies` (to open tabs in a container),
`contextualIdentities` (the spaces), `nativeMessaging` (the pull request search and
the daily copy, and the bridge for agents when it is on), `alarms` (their timing, and
archiving), `clipboardWrite` (⌘⇧C, the menu's Copy address and Copy for Claude), and
`menus` and `menus.overrideContext` (the context menu in Tidier's sidebar, and "Open link
in" on a link's menu).
The rest are optional, with Tidier alone only, each asked for by your click when it
is first of use: a permission added to the required ones makes Firefox hold every
later update until it is approved, with only a badge to show it (a unit test stops
that). Everything works without them, as it says here:

- `tabHide`, when Tidier alone is turned on: other spaces' tabs hidden.
- `webRequest`, `webRequestBlocking` and access to all websites, in the same click:
  a page stopped before it loads in the wrong space (below, Isolation). For this Tidier
  reads no page and keeps no record of where you go; all it looks at is the address of a
  tab's next page and the container it is in. Clearing a site's cookies is offered once
  this is given, since the cookies API shows nothing without it. The same access, which
  is one permission, is what ⌥-click on a link uses (`peek.js`, a small script in every
  page that does nothing but send the address of a link you ⌥-click), and what Copy for
  Claude and the bridge use to read a page, only when you ask or an agent works in a space
  you opened to it.
- `proxy` (with `webRequest`, `webRequestBlocking` and access to all websites, since at a
  start a page must be stopped before it goes past the proxy: below, Isolation), when a
  space is first given a proxy, and `browsingData`, when you first sign out of everything
  in a space.
- `search`, `history` and `bookmarks`, when you choose *Also search history and bookmarks*
  in the command bar.

No required host permissions and no data collection. The only network use is icons: a
placeholder with no saved icon tries the site's `/favicon.ico`, and Tidier's sidebar
loads tabs' icons from where the site has them (not for a space with a proxy, whose tabs
show their first letter). No IP lookups, nothing else by itself. Sync across machines,
when you turn it on, goes through Firefox Sync's own storage for add-ons, and the bridge
only through a socket on this machine.

## Isolation

With Tidier alone every space is a Firefox container, so its logins, cookies and what
sites store are its own, and it should be something nobody has to think about.
`alone_isolation` checks it with a local server that records each request and its
cookies, so what is checked is what really left the browser.

Guaranteed, with the permission for it (`isolation.js`, `whereItBelongs`):

- **No web page is loaded outside a space.** A request with no container is stopped
  before it leaves and opened in the active space, also a tab restored or opened by
  something else, and a link that starts Firefox itself. (That last one Firefox only
  holds for a listener it remembers: from the first start after moving over, or the
  second after giving the permission later. Until then such a page goes out with no
  login, and is moved to its space as soon as Tidier has started.) An essential with no
  container becomes one of the active space.
- **A rule's address opens in its space, from the first request on,** on a tab's first
  page and for an address you type or choose. A cookie set in one space is not sent in
  another. If the tab there cannot be opened, the page is not loaded and the line says its
  address: it is never sent from the wrong space instead.
- **A tab does not move because of where it passes through.** A link followed inside a
  page and a redirect do not count: with Sidebery's rules, which look at everything a
  tab loads, a sign-in passing through an address took your tab with it. A reload,
  Firefox restoring a tab, a popup, and a tab you moved by hand stay too, and so does
  going back to such an address.
- **Nothing is lost for it.** Only a tab holding nothing is closed, and only once the new
  one is there. An address you type in a tab showing a page, or in a saved tab, an essential
  or a tab in a folder, opens in its space, and that tab stays as it was. A tab outside
  any container is opened again as what it was: in its folder, with its saved address, in
  the same place in every window. If it cannot be opened at all, the line says the address.
- **No rule can hold up a page.** A rule's regular expression runs in time that grows
  with the address and never more (`rulematch.js`): on Firefox's own engine `/(a+)+$/`
  takes days on an address of forty a's, while every page in every tab waits, and an
  extension cannot stop it. That leaves out look-around and back-references, which a rule
  about an address hardly ever needs; the settings page says so, and such a rule does
  nothing. A rule for a space that is gone also does nothing, and says so there. Whatever
  else goes wrong, a request is let through after ten seconds. A navigation costs
  microseconds here, and a tab is only looked up when it may have to move.

Not guaranteed:

- **Without the permission,** a link's first request goes out with no container, and
  the tab is then opened again in its space. It carries no login, since those are all
  in spaces, but the site does see it.
- **Addresses Firefox hides from every extension** (addons.mozilla.org, accounts.firefox.com
  and a few more) cannot be stopped: no extension sees those requests. One opened with no
  container goes out with no login, and is moved to a space as soon as it shows, so it
  doesn't stay outside one (checked). A rule for one works the same way, and a space's
  proxy or user agent may not apply there.
- For a moment during an update of Tidier nothing is listening. A link opened just then
  goes out with no login, and is moved in the same way (checked).
- A page you reach by a link inside another stays in that space, with that space's
  login, whatever a rule says about its address: that is the point of the line above.
- **A rule works for any page.** A page in one space that links to or opens a rule's
  address gets it opened in the rule's space, with that space's login, as you would want
  for a link. So a site can reach another space's login that way with a plain request;
  a form stays where it is. Keep rules to addresses you would follow a link to.
- A frame with `sandbox` can send its page on with no name on the request, which looks
  just like an address you type, so that page's tab can be sent where a rule says. After
  three in ten seconds a tab stays where it is, so two such pages cannot go on for ever.
- Going back through an address a rule has, after Firefox has restarted, opens it in the
  rule's space: which addresses a tab passed through is not kept over a restart.
- **A space's logins are separate; Firefox's other data is not.** History, bookmarks,
  saved passwords and downloads are per Firefox. Private windows are left alone, and
  `about:` pages, extensions' pages and files have no space. Firefox's own requests
  (its updates, say) are in no space.
- **A proxy is not anonymity.** It carries a space's requests, with the names looked up
  there too for SOCKS; a proxy that does not answer means no page rather than going
  directly (checked). Addresses on this machine never go through one: that is Firefox's
  rule. Sites can still recognise you by the login, or by the browser itself. At a start
  Firefox decides on the proxy for the tabs it restores before any extension has run; such a
  page is stopped before anything is sent and asked for again through the proxy (checked),
  but the name may have been looked up by then.
- **A user agent is only the header.** A page's scripts can still read the real one.
  Only the spaces that set one are changed, but while any does, each request of every
  space passes Tidier for an instant.
- **Signing out takes** cookies, IndexedDB and local storage, for one space. Firefox
  cannot clear a cache or service workers for one container, so those stay; they hold
  no login, but pages already open show it only when they next load.
- **A container that vanishes comes back, usually without its logins** (`Refresh Firefox`,
  a lost `containers.json`): Tidier remembers each space's name, colour and icon, makes it
  again at a start and says so. A login only comes along if Firefox gives it its old number
  back; another space's number is never used. It cannot tell that from a container removed
  while Tidier wasn't running. One removed while it runs stays removed, and its essentials,
  folders and rules are gone with it.
- A placeholder fetching a site's icon does so in its own container, as a page would.

## Files

- `common.js` – shared queue and helpers. Every change runs through one queue
  so events cannot race into duplicate tabs.
- `essentials.js` – essentials (pinned tabs) in every window.
- `tabsync.js` – live/ghost tab sync. Roles and keys are stored per tab with
  `sessions.setTabValue`, so they survive a restart. Tree structure is read
  from `openerTabId`, which Sidebery keeps equal to the parent in its tree.
- `folders.js` – folders first in each space (see above).
- `livefolders.js` – live folders of GitHub pull requests (see above).
- `ghost.html` / `ghost.js` – placeholder page for ghosts, essential copies and never-loaded live tabs.
- `archive.js` – archiving of unused tabs.
- `archivelist.js`, `sidebar/archived.js` – the list of archived and closed tabs, per space.
- `shortcuts.js` – one table for every key, the command bar's and Claude's included; ⌘⇧C
  copies the address. `keys-commands.js`, `settings/keys.js`, `sidebar/keys.js` and
  `sidebar/keyrename.js` – what the keys do with Tidier alone, the settings page's Keys
  section, and keys in the sidebar.
- `commandbar.js`, `commandbar/` (the bar's page, and `rank.js`, what it shows for what you
  type), `sidebar/commandbar-link.js` – the command bar.
- `spaces.js` – spaces: hiding, switching, new tabs and links, rules.
- `spaceactions.js`, `sidebar/spacemenu.js` – a space's menu and what it does (rename,
  unload, clear).
- `newtabs.js`, `sidebar/newtab.js` – one place for new tabs.
- `safemoves.js`, `sidebar/reconnect.js` – moves to another space that cannot lose
  anything; the sidebar connecting again after its background part has come back.
- `foldrest.js` – a closed folder rests: hidden and unloaded.
- `quiet.js`, `sidebar/note.js` – the quiet line, Undo and Clear.
- `tabnames.js`, `sidebar/renamekept.js` – names of your own for essentials and saved tabs.
- `sounds.js`, `sidebar/sound.js` – where sound comes from.
- `news.js`, `sidebar/news.js` – a still dot when a page in the background has news.
- `littlewindow.js`, `peek.js`, `sidebar/littlewindow.js`, `settings/littlewindow.js` – the
  small window for links from other apps, "Open link in", and ⌥-click.
- `hiddenspaces.js`, `syncmerge.js`, `sync.js`, `settings/sync.js` – spaces hidden on one
  machine, and the same essentials, folders and spaces on every machine through Firefox Sync
  (`syncmerge.js` is how two versions become one, with no Firefox needed to test it).
- `bridge.js`, `bridge-page.js`, `sidebar/agent.js`, `settings/bridge.js`,
  `native/tidier-mcp.py`, `native/tidier-bridge.py` – Copy for Claude and the bridge for
  agents (above).
- `rulematch.js` – whether a rule matches an address, in time that can't blow up.
- `isolation.js`, `settings/spaces.js`, `sidebar/isolation.js` – nothing goes out in the wrong container; a
  space's proxy and user agent; signing out; new, edited and deleted spaces; a vanished
  container brought back; a copy of a tab, and a folder, to another space.
- `ownfolders.js` – Tidier's own folders, moving tabs.
- `tabactions.js` – what the menu on a tab does (the menu itself: `sidebar/tabmenu.js`;
  the small menu Tidier draws: `sidebar/menu.js`).
- `sidebar-view.js`, `sidebar/` – Tidier's own sidebar; among its parts `selection.js`
  (several tabs), `drag.js`, `stayput.js` (the list shows where you are) and `touches.js`
  (the slow-load sign and warming up a tab). `sidebar/tokens.css` holds the colours and
  sizes of every page Tidier draws.
- `copies.js` – the daily copy of Tidier's data, and taking one in, matched to spaces by name.
- `moveover.js`, `settings/` – the settings page, and moving a browser over from Sidebery.
- `tools/fix_spaces.py` – put tabs back in their own Sidebery space (in your
  own Firefox, which it restarts).
- `tools/from_arc_zen.py` – your spaces, essentials, pinned tabs and folders from Arc or
  Zen, as a file the settings page takes in like a copy. Only reads Arc and Zen.
- `tools/shoot.py` – pictures of what Tidier draws, for working on its look: every
  space and width, light and dark, hover, menus, empty spaces, the settings page.
- `tests/` – the unit tests, the smoke test, the test Firefox and its fixtures, the random
  sequences (`chaos.test.mjs` on `chaos_firefox.mjs`) and the long run (`soak.py`).
- `.github/workflows/smoke.yml`, `tools/setup-ci-keys.sh` – the smoke test on GitHub.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `tools/release.py`, `tools/setup-amo-key.sh` –
  signing and releases (see below).

## Releases and updates

Every push to `main` that changes the extension ends up in your Firefox on
its own:

1. The smoke test runs on GitHub (`.github/workflows/smoke.yml`). A failed
   first try gets one more try in the same job, whatever failed, and leaves a
   warning on the run. It is there for the known pin race.
2. When a run on `main` passes (a push, by hand or the weekly one),
   `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs `tools/release.py`:
   - it builds the `.xpi` with version `major.minor.<number of commits>`, e.g.
     1.6.7, so nobody has to bump it;
   - addons.mozilla.org signs it as *unlisted* (not in its catalogue), because
     Firefox only installs signed extensions;
   - it puts the `.xpi` and `updates.json` on a GitHub Release.
3. Firefox reads `updates.json` through `update_url` in `manifest.json` and
   installs the new version by itself. It checks once a day; *Check for
   updates* in `about:addons` checks at once.

Nothing is released when only the documents (`README.md`, `FEATURES.md`,
`PLAN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`), tests, tools, `native/` or `.github/` changed; none of them goes
into the extension. Change `major.minor` in `manifest.json` for a bigger change. `tools/release.py
--dry-run DIR` builds the `.xpi` and `updates.json` locally without signing.

If a release is bad, Firefox never goes back to an older version, so the way
out is a newer one:

1. To stop it spreading, mark the release before it as the latest:
   `gh release edit v<older> --latest -R CHaerem/tidier`. `update_url` follows
   the latest release, so Firefoxes that have not updated yet stay where they are.
2. `git revert` the commit and push. It gets a higher version, and Firefox
   updates to it.
3. If the smoke test is red for another reason (a new Firefox or Sidebery) and
   the fix cannot wait, run the release yourself from the reverted commit, with
   the AMO key in `AMO_JWT_ISSUER` and `AMO_JWT_SECRET`: `tools/release.py`.
   It skips the test, so do this only for a revert.

Set up once:

- The AMO API key: create it at
  <https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/api/key/> and run
  `tools/setup-amo-key.sh`, which stores it as the secrets `AMO_JWT_ISSUER`
  and `AMO_JWT_SECRET`. Only the release workflow, which runs code from `main`,
  can read them.
- Firefox: install the first release by hand (open the `.xpi` from the newest
  [release](https://github.com/CHaerem/tidier/releases)). Versions before
  1.6 have no `update_url`, so they cannot find updates.

## Testing

From fastest to most complete:

```bash
node --test                          # unit tests, about half a minute
tests/smoke.py --only trees,folders  # some smoke test groups, about a minute
tests/smoke.py                       # the whole smoke test, about 45 minutes
tests/smoke.py --installed           # the signed version installed in your Firefox
tests/smoke.py --xpi FILE            # a given signed .xpi
tests/smoke.py --serial              # in one test Firefox
tests/smoke.py --part alone          # one half of that (or --part sidebery), as on GitHub
```

Runs to do on purpose, not after every change:

```bash
CHAOS_SEQUENCES=15000 CHAOS_SECONDS=0 node --test tests/chaos.test.mjs  # random use, for a night
tests/soak.py [--alone] [--minutes N] [--seed N] [--port P]          # a long run in a real test Firefox
TIDIER_MANY=1000 tests/smoke.py --only alone_setup,alone_many         # measured with a thousand tabs
tools/shoot.py                                                       # pictures of what Tidier draws
```

`tests/chaos.test.mjs` plays random sequences of browser use on the real background
scripts, on a fake Firefox (`tests/chaos_firefox.mjs`) that refuses what Firefox refuses,
and checks after each what Tidier promises: no tab lost or doubled, every essential in
every window, every tab in its space, nothing left in memory. A failure prints a line to
run that one sequence again (`CHAOS_REPLAY='…'`, with `CHAOS_TRACE=1` for every call).
`tests/soak.py` does the same slowly in a real test Firefox, with Sidebery or `--alone`,
clicking and dragging in the real sidebar, and also fails on memory that grows or on
work while nothing happens. Restarts in it (`--restart-every N`) need Developer Edition
(`TIDIER_FIREFOX`, `TIDIER_MUST_RESTART=1`).

The unit tests (`tests/unit.test.mjs`) cover the logic that needs no Firefox:
the order a window's tabs are put in, and moving tabs without breaking
Sidebery's tree, against a small model of how Sidebery rebuilds its tree after
a move. Change that logic test-first there. `tests/background.test.mjs` runs
the real background scripts on a fake Firefox (`tests/fake_firefox.mjs`), for
what is hard to bring about in a real one: a start with no windows, a refused
call during a start, an essential in a removed container.

The group names for `--only` are the check functions in `tests/smoke.py`
(`new_window`, `essentials`, `folders`, `trees`, …); a group that needs the
second window gets it first. Without `--only`, the groups run in several test
Firefoxes at once (`SHARDS`), one of them without Sidebery, for Tidier alone
(`ALONE_GROUPS`, in `alone_*`). That one is the longest, about 45 minutes while the
others are done in about seven, since its groups build on each other and run in order:
judge a failure there by the whole chain, as a subset leaves out what earlier groups
leave behind. `TIDIER_ALONE_ALL_PERMISSIONS=1` runs it with every optional permission
given, as in real use. Two smoke tests at once need their own ports (`--port`), and a
second one on the same ports says so.

A test must not switch Marionette through every tab's handle to find a page: that
loads every unloaded tab on the way, and a closed folder's tabs would no longer rest.
`into_page` in `tests/smoke.py` asks for the one tab's handle instead.

The smoke test runs in an invisible test Firefox with a throwaway profile
(`tests/testfirefox.py`), so it never touches your own Firefox: no restart, no
window, no clipboard, its own Marionette port (one per test Firefox). The
profile is deleted afterwards. It is built the same way every time, from:

- dotfiles (`~/src/private/dotfiles/home/firefox`, or `TIDIER_DOTFILES`):
  `user.js`, `userChrome.css`, `customKeys.json` and Sidebery's CSS, so it
  tests the setup as dotfiles says it is;
- `tests/fixtures`: Sidebery's spaces and settings, and the containers, made
  from your own setup without any addresses by `tests/fixtures/from_backup.py`
  (run it again when you change spaces or containers);
- Sidebery as you have it installed (or, if your Firefox has none, the newest
  from addons.mozilla.org, kept for a day in `~/Library/Caches/tidier`),
  with its permissions and ⌃1/⌃2/⌃3;
- Tidier (this folder, or a signed `.xpi`);
- test tabs in each space: essentials, a folder with tabs, ordinary tabs.
- a stand-in for the live folders' native host (`tests/fake_github_host.py`),
  which answers from a file the test writes, so live folders are tested
  everywhere without your `gh` login or GitHub.

The list of what it checks is at the top of `tests/smoke.py`. Each group of
checks runs on its own; a check that crashes counts as failed. Run it after
changing the extension or dotfiles' Firefox files, and after Firefox or
Sidebery updates (timing in `common.js` depends on how Sidebery handles new
tabs).

A headless Firefox has no real window focus, and the macOS hand-over of links
from other apps cannot be emulated in it; the test checks the part that keeps
logins apart (a tab without a container lands in the active space's
container).

### On GitHub

`.github/workflows/smoke.yml` runs the same smoke test on GitHub, in a
headless Firefox on a macOS runner with the newest Sidebery, both in the newest
Firefox and in Firefox Developer Edition (the Beta, about four weeks ahead, so a
Firefox change that would break the setup shows up before it reaches you). Each runs
in two parts on runners of their own, the Sidebery groups and the Tidier-alone chain,
since the chain alone takes longer than one job could for both.
Developer Edition allows unsigned add-ons, so there Tidier is installed for
real and the test also quits and restarts Firefox to check the restored
session; on your Mac that part runs with `--installed` or `--xpi`. It
runs on pushes and pull requests here and every Monday, so a Firefox or
Sidebery update that breaks something shows up without any change here; after
changing the Firefox files in dotfiles, start it by hand (Actions → Smoke test
→ Run workflow). GitHub e-mails you when a run fails.

The Firefox files come from your private dotfiles, read with a read-only
deploy key (deploy keys do not expire). Set it up once, in your own terminal:

```bash
tools/setup-ci-keys.sh
```

During development you can also load it by hand: `about:debugging` → This
Firefox → Load Temporary Add-on → `manifest.json`.
